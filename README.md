# The-C-Attacks-again
This is my personal Repo for learning C++, it is created during the Computer-Science Class in School. All of this is cool stuff and can be used in other projects. 

Thank you Mr. Hannes.

#Build
Just clone the Repo and build the main file using make. The output is called programm and is directly executable. This uses the Clang Compiler so you'll need a Mac custom makefiles for Linux should be possible.
